se2dr is a dynamic rupture implementation on the spectral wave propagator code se2wave available as a branch at https://bitbucket.org/dmay/se2wave/

The used commit ID to generate the figures in the manuscript is [1effef0a9baf0b027e1c699a8201e00bcda14bee](https://bitbucket.org/dmay/se2wave/commits/1effef0a9baf0b027e1c699a8201e00bcda14bee)

Use one of the listed commands in the file **In_OptionFile_ALL.sh** to run the numerical test of interest. Replace the paths with your local petsc folder location, the location of the folder for se2dr, and the storage location.
